<h1>When you give blood, it is collected so it can be used to treat someone else.</h1>
<p>
Giving blood saves lives. The blood you give is a lifeline in an
emergency for people who need long-term treatments.
</p>
<p>
For most people, giving blood is easy and follows the simple steps listed below.
</p> 
<h2> Before giving blood</h2>
<ul>
<li>Check if you can give blood</li>
<li>Register online to be donor</li>
<li>SignIn to your account and book an appointment</li>
</ul>  
<h2> When you give blood</h2>
<p>
This is what will happen when you attend your appointment</p>
<h3>1. Health screening</h3>
<p>We make sure it is safe for you to donate, and that your blood donation is safe for a patient to receive.<p>
<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We confirm your identity and ask you about the information on your donor health check form; a registered nurse may follow up if necessary.</p>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you are not able to donate we will explain why, and may ask you to make another appointment.
<h3>2.Your blood donation?</h3>
We examine your arm and place a cuff on your arm to maintain a small amount of pressure during donation (this does not measure blood pressure).
<p>
We then examine your arm to find a suitable vein and clean it with an antiseptic sponge.</br>
Then We will insert a needle in your arm which will collect your blood into a blood bag with your unique donor number.<br>
You should not feel any discomfort or pain. If you do, tell a member of staff.<br>
A scale weighs the blood and stops when you have donated 470ml (or just under a pint). This usually takes between 5-10 minutes.</br>
The needle will be removed and a sterile dressing applied to your arm.
